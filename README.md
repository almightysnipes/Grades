# Grades
User will simply enter a numerical score in the text box that's between 1 and 100. For each score that is inserted, a letter grade will appear. For example, if the user's score is an 80, they have a letter grade of a B. If the user's score is a 30, they have a letter grade of an F.

Solution was developed in VB.NET.
